# WebOne
This is a HTTP 1.x proxy that makes old web browsers usable again in the Web 2.0 world.

The proxy should be ran on a modern PC with .NET Framework 4.6 (or newer).
Probably should work in Mono too. Older versions of .NET are impossible to work with modern TLS chipers and are obsolete like the clients of this proxy. But you may try to recompile for Win2003 or XP with .NET 4.0.

This HTTP Proxy server is working at port 80 and compatible even with Netscape 3.
Other browsers should also work with WebOne.
