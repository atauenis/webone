<h1>Unsupported protocol</h1>
<p>You're attempted to request content from <i>%URL%</i>. The protocol specified in the URL is not supported by this proxy server.</p>
<p>Consider connect directly to the server, bypassing the proxy. This error message may also appear if your Web browser settings have enabled <b>&quot;Use proxy for all protocols&quot;</b> option. Uncheck it and set only for protocols supported by WebOne. List of them can be found in project's Wiki.</p>
