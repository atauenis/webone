                                    details. Supported channels: stable, nightly
    -i, --ignore-errors             Ignore download and postprocessing errors.
                                    The download will be considered successful
                                    even if the postprocessing fails
    --no-abort-on-error             Continue with next video on download errors;
                                    e.g. to skip unavailable videos in a
                                    playlist (default)
    --abort-on-error                Abort downloading of further videos if an
                                    error occurs (Alias: --no-ignore-errors)
    --dump-user-agent               Display the current user-agent and exit
    --list-extractors               List all supported extractors and exit
    --extractor-descriptions        Output descriptions of all supported
                                    extractors and exit
    --use-extractors NAMES          Extractor names to use separated by commas.
                                    You can also use regexes, "all", "default"
                                    and "end" (end URL matching); e.g. --ies
                                    "holodex.*,end,youtube". Prefix the name
                                    with a "-" to exclude it, e.g. --ies
                                    default,-generic. Use --list-extractors for
                                    a list of extractor names. (Alias: --ies)
    --default-search PREFIX         Use this prefix for unqualified URLs. E.g.
                                    "gvsearch2:python" downloads two videos from
                                    google videos for the search term "python".
                                    Use the value "auto" to let yt-dlp guess
                                    ("auto_warning" to emit a warning when
                                    guessing). "error" just throws an error. The
                                    default value "fixup_error" repairs broken
                                    URLs, but emits an error if this is not
                                    possible instead of searching
    --ignore-config                 Don't load any more configuration files
                                    except those given by --config-locations.
                                    For backward compatibility, if this option
                                    is found inside the system configuration
                                    file, the user configuration is not loaded.
                                    (Alias: --no-config)
    --no-config-locations           Do not load any custom configuration files
                                    (default). When given inside a configuration
                                    file, ignore all previous --config-locations
                                    defined in the current file
    --config-locations PATH         Location of the main configuration file;
                                    either the path to the config or its
                                    containing directory ("-" for stdin). Can be
                                    used multiple times and inside other
                                    configuration files
    --flat-playlist                 Do not extract the videos of a playlist,
                                    only list them
    --no-flat-playlist              Fully extract the videos of a playlist
                                    (default)
    --live-from-start               Download livestreams from the start.
                                    Currently only supported for YouTube
                                    (Experimental)
    --no-live-from-start            Download livestreams from the current time
                                    (default)
    --wait-for-video MIN[-MAX]      Wait for scheduled streams to become
                                    available. Pass the minimum number of
                                    seconds (or range) to wait between retries
    --no-wait-for-video             Do not wait for scheduled streams (default)
    --mark-watched                  Mark videos watched (even with --simulate)
    --no-mark-watched               Do not mark videos watched (default)
    --color [STREAM:]POLICY         Whether to emit color codes in output,
                                    optionally prefixed by the STREAM (stdout or
                                    stderr) to apply the setting to. Can be one
                                    of "always", "auto" (default), "never", or
                                    "no_color" (use non color terminal
                                    sequences). Can be used multiple times
    --compat-options OPTS           Options that can help keep compatibility
                                    with youtube-dl or youtube-dlc
                                    configurations by reverting some of the
                                    changes made in yt-dlp. See "Differences in
                                    default behavior" for details
    --alias ALIASES OPTIONS         Create aliases for an option string. Unless
                                    an alias starts with a dash "-", it is
                                    prefixed with "--". Arguments are parsed
                                    according to the Python string formatting
                                    mini-language. E.g. --alias get-audio,-X
                                    "-S=aext:{0},abr -x --audio-format {0}"
                                    creates options "--get-audio" and "-X" that
                                    takes an argument (ARG0) and expands to
                                    "-S=aext:ARG0,abr -x --audio-format ARG0".
                                    All defined aliases are listed in the --help
                                    output. Alias options can trigger more
                                    aliases; so be careful to avoid defining
                                    recursive options. As a safety measure, each
                                    alias may be triggered a maximum of 100
                                    times. This option can be used multiple
                                    times

  Network Options:
    --proxy URL                     Use the specified HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxy. To
                                    enable SOCKS proxy, specify a proper scheme,
                                    e.g. socks5://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1080/.
                                    Pass in an empty string (--proxy "") for
                                    direct connection
    --socket-timeout SECONDS        Time to wait before giving up, in seconds
    --source-address IP             Client-side IP address to bind to
    -4, --force-ipv4                Make all connections via IPv4
    -6, --force-ipv6                Make all connections via IPv6
    --enable-file-urls              Enable file:// URLs. This is disabled by
                                    default for security reasons.

  Geo-restriction:
    --geo-verification-proxy URL    Use this proxy to verify the IP address for
                                    some geo-restricted sites. The default proxy
                                    specified by --proxy (or none, if the option
                                    is not present) is used for the actual
                                    downloading
    --xff VALUE                     How to fake X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to
                                    try bypassing geographic restriction. One of
                                    "default" (only when known to be useful),
                                    "never", an IP block in CIDR notation, or a
                                    two-letter ISO 3166-2 country code

  Video Selection:
    -I, --playlist-items ITEM_SPEC  Comma separated playlist_index of the items
                                    to download. You can specify a range using
                                    "[START]:[STOP][:STEP]". For backward
                                    compatibility, START-STOP is also supported.
                                    Use negative indices to count from the right
                                    and negative STEP to download in reverse
                                    order. E.g. "-I 1:3,7,-5::2" used on a
                                    playlist of size 15 will download the items
                                    at index 1,2,3,7,11,13,15
    --min-filesize SIZE             Abort download if filesize is smaller than
                                    SIZE, e.g. 50k or 44.6M
    --max-filesize SIZE             Abort download if filesize is larger than
                                    SIZE, e.g. 50k or 44.6M
    --date DATE                     Download only videos uploaded on this date.
                                    The date can be "YYYYMMDD" or in the format 
                                    [now|today|yesterday][-N[day|week|month|year
                                    ]]. E.g. "--date today-2weeks" downloads
                                    only videos uploaded on the same day two
                                    weeks ago
    --datebefore DATE               Download only videos uploaded on or before
                                    this date. The date formats accepted is the
                                    same as --date
    --dateafter DATE                Download only videos uploaded on or after
                                    this date. The date formats accepted is the
                                    same as --date
    --match-filters FILTER          Generic video filter. Any "OUTPUT TEMPLATE"
                                    field can be compared with a number or a
                                    string using the operators defined in
                                    "Filtering Formats". You can also simply
                                    specify a field to match if the field is
                                    present, use "!field" to check if the field
                                    is not present, and "&" to check multiple
                                    conditions. Use a "\" to escape "&" or
                                    quotes if needed. If used multiple times,
                                    the filter matches if atleast one of the
                                    conditions are met. E.g. --match-filter
                                    !is_live --match-filter "like_count>?100 &
                                    description~='(?i)\bcats \& dogs\b'" matches
                                    only videos that are not live OR those that
                                    have a like count more than 100 (or the like
                                    field is not available) and also has a
                                    description that contains the phrase "cats &
                                    dogs" (caseless). Use "--match-filter -" to
                                    interactively ask whether to download each
                                    video
    --no-match-filters              Do not use any --match-filter (default)
    --break-match-filters FILTER    Same as "--match-filters" but stops the

    --no-break-match-filters        Do not use any --break-match-filters
                                    (default)
    --no-playlist                   Download only the video, if the URL refers
                                    to a video and a playlist
    --yes-playlist                  Download the playlist, if the URL refers to

    --skip-playlist-after-errors N  Number of allowed failures until the rest of
                                    the playlist is skipped

  Download Options:

                                    concatable. The "pl_video:" prefix can be
                                    used with "--paths" and "--output" to set
                                    the output filename for the concatenated

    --exec [WHEN:]CMD               Execute a command, optionally prefixed with
                                    when to execute it, separated by a ":".
                                    Supported values of "WHEN" are the same as
                                    that of --use-postprocessor (default:
                                    after_move). Same syntax as the output
                                    template can be used to pass any field as
                                    arguments to the command. If no fields are
                                    passed, %(filepath,_filename|)q is appended
                                    to the end of the command. This option can
                                    be used multiple times

                                    syntax as --remux-video
    --split-chapters                Split video into multiple files based on
                                    internal chapters. The "chapter:" prefix can
                                    be used with "--paths" and "--output" to set
                                    the output filename for the split files. See
                                    "OUTPUT TEMPLATE" for details
    --no-split-chapters             Do not split video based on chapters

                                    downloading/splitting/removing sections.
                                    This is slow due to needing a re-encode, but
                                    the resulting video may have fewer artifacts
                                    around the cuts
    --no-force-keyframes-at-cuts    Do not force keyframes around the chapters
                                    when cutting/splitting (default)

                                    separated by a colon ":". ARGS are a
                                    semicolon ";" delimited list of NAME=VALUE.
                                    The "when" argument determines when the
                                    postprocessor is invoked. It can be one of
                                    "pre_process" (after video extraction),
                                    "after_filter" (after video passes filter),
                                    "video" (after --format; before
                                    --print/--output), "before_dl" (before each
                                    video download), "post_process" (after each
                                    video download; default), "after_move"
                                    (after moving video file to it's final
                                    locations), "after_video" (after downloading
                                    and processing all formats of a video), or
                                    "playlist" (at end of playlist). This option
                                    can be used multiple times to add different
                                    postprocessors
